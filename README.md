# RISC-V-Emulator
Emulator for RISC V assembler

## Plan
  1. Support all commands used in the assembly language course

    * Basic system calls
    * Simple commands:
      * mv
      * li
      * Math operations
      * addi
      * Logical operations
    * Labels
    * Comments
    * NSS commands:
      * j
      * bgt, beq, bez, etc...
    * Macro
    * Stack functions:
      * lw
      * sw
    * Functions:
      * call
      * ret

  2. Debug

    Step by step debuging and viewing registers and stack

  3. Visual

    Maybe some pseudo graphics

## Architecture

  0. PreProcessor
  1. Parser 
  2. Interpreter 
  3. Debuger
  4. View?
